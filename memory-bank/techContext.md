# Technical Context: Eltako Component for Home Assistant

## Technologies Used
1. **Python 3.x**: Main programming language
2. **Home Assistant Core**: Home automation integration platform
3. **EnOcean Protocol**: For communication with Eltako devices
4. **Serial Interface (pyserial)**: For communication with the USB300 dongle
5. **Asyncio**: For asynchronous operation management

## Development Environment
- Operating System: Compatible with Linux, Windows, macOS
- Recommended Python virtual environment
- Testing possible via Home Assistant development instance
- Deployment via HACS or manual installation in custom_components

## Dependencies
- Home Assistant Core (minimum version to be determined)
- Standard Python libraries (asyncio, logging, etc.)
- Pyserial library for serial communication

## Technical Constraints
1. **EnOcean Protocol Limitations**:
   - No message receipt confirmation
   - Limited bandwidth
   - Variable radio range depending on environment

2. **Hardware Limitations**:
   - Dependency on USB300 dongle or equivalent
   - No automatic device discovery

3. **Home Assistant Limitations**:
   - Need to adapt to entity lifecycles
   - Compliance with integration conventions
   
## Technical Architecture
- **Asynchronous**: Using Python's async/await model
- **Event-Driven**: Event-based communication
- **Modular**: Clear separation of responsibilities between modules
- **Extensible**: Design allowing easy addition of new device types
